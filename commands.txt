# - The node core container uses the 'host'. This is to avoid complexity in implementing the mechanism of 'discovering' nodes. 
# 	The library dtn7-go comes with its own automatic 'discovery' of nodes mechanism, using a multicast network. //To see the address search for file 0doc.go

# 	Implementing a mechanism of 'discovery' (as may real-life DTN nodes would work) may take some time, 
#	and currently, the tight schedule isn't enabling that to the prototype.
